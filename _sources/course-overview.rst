Course Overview
================

Read this page for details on how this course works, what you must do to pass the course, how to submit your work, and how to get help.

Class Rhythm
------------

In this course, there are two settings in which you will learn and work on stuff:

* **Before Class:** Before each class period, you should read the next chapter from the book, and work on the associated exercises.
* **During Class:** During class time, we will go over the material you read, and work on practice problems in small groups.

Before Class
    * **Read:** Each chapter in the book contains a handful of pages you should read. The readings are interspersed with interactive components such as active code examples with which you can tinker and explore, and multiple-choice questions so you can self-check your understanding.
    * **Attempt Exercises:** At the end of each chapter is a page containing a handful of exercises for you to practice. Some are easy, others are hard. You will probably spend the majority of your time working on these exercises. You do not have to complete them all, but you must attempt at least 5 for each chapter. You are encouraged to to more, and to try to get them correct, but the minimum is that you attempt at least 5.

During Class
    * **Review:** In class, we will review the material from the chapter you read, with live examples and question-and-answer sessions.
    * **Studios:** You will sometimes be asked to work together in small groups on another practice exercise called a "Studio".


See the `Course Schedule`_ for a week-by-week breakdown.


Requirements
------------

This course is Pass/Fail. There are two levels of certification:

* **Pass with Honors:** For students who complete all of the work on time.
* **Pass:** For students who complete all of the work, mostly on time (more details below).

Summer of Code consists of 3 units, of which *Think Python* is the first. You will receive a status of Pass with Honors, Pass, or Fail for each unit. In order to Pass the entire course, you must Pass each individual unit. In order to Pass with Honors, you must Pass with Honors each individual unit.

Evaluation
    In order to pass the course, you will be evaluated on three different criteria:

    * Participation
    * Weekly Graded Assignments
    * Final Problem Set

Participation
    Participation simply means that you are keeping up with the pace of the class and doing the required work: reading all the chapters, attempting 5 or more exercises for each chapter, attending class, and working on studios in class.

Weekly Graded Assignments
    As mentioned, each chapter contains a page with exercises that you should work on. Usually, one of those exercises will be specially marked as "GRADED", meaning that you must submit your code (and it must actually work, performing correctly under a set of automated tests). See below for more details on submitting assignments.

Final Problem Set
    Towards the end of class, you will complete and turn in a larger programming assignment, which will also be graded by automated tests.

Deadlines
* **Weekly Assignments** must be submitted by end-of-day on Sunday of the week they are assigned.

* **The Problem Set** must be submitted at the end of Unit 1 (see `Course Schedule`_ for exact date).

* Lateness Policy
    In order to pass the class you must complete all the work, but you may submit up to two late Weekly Assignments, and you may miss a few class sessions. If you need to submit more than two late assignments, you may be allowed to continue in the course, but you must speak to the course instructor.


Submitting Assignments
----------------------

We will be using Vocareum for homework submission. On Vocareum, you will see a list of Assignments with names like *Weekly Assignment: Chapter 3*. When you click on the assignment you will see more detailed instructions.


Getting help
------------

During class, mentors will circulate and provide help while you are working.

Outside of class, we use a discussion board forum called Piazza, which you can use to ask questions.

Academic Honesty
----------------

Academic honesty is an important focus of this course. Working with others to improve your skills is both acceptable and encouraged, but there is a difference between asking for help from a classmate and submitting the work of a classmate. Below are some examples to differentiate between the two:

- If you encounter a bug in your program, a classmate may look at your code to help you identify the source of your problem, but you may not look at the classmateâ€™s code to find their solution to that problem.

- You may search through sites such as Stack Overflow when trying to debug an error in your code, but you may not search online for solutions to your specific assignment.

- Do not post complete programs or functions on public Piazza posts or other course platforms. Post only snippets or isolated sections of code. If you need to post a complete program or function in order to get help, do so in a private message to the TFs or instructors.

If you have a question about how to work with another student on graded homework, as the instructor or course staff.
