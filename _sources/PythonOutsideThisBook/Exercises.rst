Exercises
---------

You just read about how using Python "beyond the browser". Indeed, Python can be run directly on your own computer without an internet connection.

To give you some practice running Python locally on your machine, we are going to send you over on a brief detour to do some reading and exercises from a different online book, called *Learn Python the Hard Way*. Despite the intimidating title, the author presents everything as a nice detailed tutorial that makes it easy to follow along.

There are two sections you should read / do:

#. Appendix A: `Command Line Crash Course`_: This section contains 15 short tutorials teaching you the basics of how to interact with your computer's file system and operating system by typing commands into its "command line" or "terminal" program. Do all 15!

#. Once you have learned a bit about using the command-line, it's time to write and execute some Python on your own computer! Do the first six exercises from *Learn Python the Hard Way*:

	- `Exercise 0`_
	- `Exercise 1`_ 
	- `Exercise 2`_
	- `Exercise 3`_
	- `Exercise 4`_
	- (GRADED*) `Exercise 5`_

  *Notice that Exercise 5 is marked as GRADED. This means that you should go to Vocareum and look for an assignment called *Weekly Graded Exercise: Chapter 3*, and submit your Exercise 5 code over there.
