                Use the drawsquare function we wrote in this chapter in a program to draw
                the image shown below.
                Assume each side is 20 units.
                (Hint: notice that the turtle has already moved away from the ending point of the last
                square when the program ends.)

                2. Add the following lines to the top of your file. These will increase the time your program is allowed to run to 35,000 milliseconds, or 35 seconds. You can change this number, if you need to.
