Studio: Searching
===================

Pre-studio
----------

For the pre-studio, we review logic, booleans, and conditionals.

Studio
------

Write a function that takes two arguments: a list of numbers (either floats or integers, or mixed), along with a single number. The function should return ``True`` if the number is in the list, and ``False`` otherwise.

If you solve that problem with time to spare, modify your function so that it takes the same arguments, but returns the *number of times* that the number appears in the list.

.. activecode:: studio_6

    def contains_n(numbers, n):
        # Your code here, to replace this non-working version
        return False

    # Be sure to test your function with various inputs
